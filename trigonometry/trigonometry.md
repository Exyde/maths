# Trigonometry Notes

- One of the most important topic for game programming
- Study of triangle, and the relationship between the **angle** and **sides**.
- We'll focus on right triangle for now.
- Hypothenuse
  - Opposite side to the right angle
  - The longest side, mostly always
- The radian unit is the length of the radius along the circle
  - So that the angle formed is of 57.3°
  - A circle is 2$\pi$ radian
    - So a quarter is 1/2$\pi$
    - Half is $\pi$
    - 3 quarter is 1.5$\pi$

### Equations

**Conversion**

$$Degres to Radians ={180rad \over \pi}$$
$$Radians to Degrees ={\pi degrees \over 180 }$$

**Circle** 

$$ x = cos(angle) * radius $$
$$ y = sin(angle) * radius $$

 *CAH | SOH | TOA*
$$Sin(a) ={Opposite \over Hypothenuse}$$
$$Cos(a) ={Adjacent \over Hypothenuse}$$
$$Tan(a) ={Adjacent \over Hypothenuse}$$



### Reminder
- SIN (A) = Opposite / Hypothenuse => You get the ratio between two side, which is a number in [-1, 1]
