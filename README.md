Repository about [re]-learning maths concepts, and going in depth.

Based on the [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm9bqSSiIdo&list=PL7wAPgl1JVvUEb0dIygHzO4698tmcwLk9&pp=iAQB) on the channel [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/@codingmath).

After this we will get in more in-depth concept provided by Freya Holmer or Keijiro Takahashi per instance.
